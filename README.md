We are proud to introduce Fitly, a new and innovative fitness workout generator that ensures that anyone, regardless of fitness level, experience or confidence, can achieve their fitness goals. 


**What is Fitly?**

Fitly is a web-based application that recommends a workout for a user based on the user‚Äôs target muscle group and whether they want to perform a workout at home or in the gym. Fitly integrates with an API called YouTube Data API to offer a user a repository of over 200 of the top-recommended workout videos hosted on YouTube, in addition to another API called Exercise DB with hundreds of exercises. 


**Why was Fitly built?**

Fitly offers the user an opportunity to try new workouts and a chance to build fitness confidence. In a society overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of fitness-based content, Fitly offers fitness-conscious users a simple solution - the ability to pinpoint their exact workout specifications for an innovative and completely personalisable workout experience.
Fitly solves the ‚Äúhow do I get started‚Äù conundrum that often occurs when people opt to improve their health and wellness through exercise.
