We are proud to introduce Fitly, a new and innovative workout video generator that ensures that anyone, regardless of fitness level, experience or confidence can achieve their fitness goals.

**What is Fitly?**

Fitly is a web-based application that generates Youtube workout videos for the user based on the user's selection of:
1. The muscle group that they want to target
2. Whether they wish to do a workout at home or at the gym

Fitly then generates 3 recommended workout videos which are embedded in the web app, based on the user's selection.

**Why was Fitly built?**

Fitly offers the user a repository of over 200 of the top-recommended video workouts hosted on YouTube to date, an opportunity to try new workouts and a chance to build fitness confidence. In a society overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of fitness-based content, Fitly offers fitness-conscious users a simple solution - the ability to pinpoint their exact workout specifications for an innovative and completely personalisable workout experience.
Fitly solves the ‚Äúhow do I get started‚Äù conundrum that often occurs when people opt to improve their health and wellness through exercise/gym.
